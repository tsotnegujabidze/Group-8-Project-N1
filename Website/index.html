                            I have only done one project using coding and that's a Multi-page website about batman.
                            I used css and html. I didn't know css nor html while doing this project but I learnt them from watching Youtube tutorials.
                            This project made me experience coding more deeply. It gave me some sort of idea of how to make actual good website
